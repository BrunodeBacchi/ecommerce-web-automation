# Ecommerce Web Automation

The following automation in Cypress is an exercise for learning that I did using the free API system Serverest. I performed the test for the product registration and deletion features of the system.

## Product Registration

This spec performs the registration of an administrator user on the website, so that we can then register a new product and, in the end, verify if it is indeed present in the list of products. Done through the front-end of Serverest.
